If you launch the project at school, do it in goinfre, permissions are messed up. Even then, volumes' UID are different, need to find a solution for it.

Start by running npm install at the root of the folder and in the backend folder to install the necessary modules.

'chmod -R 777 backend' before docker compose up

Hot reloading works, meaning you can modify files in realtime.

Can check if it works by accessing localhost:3000 in your browser.
